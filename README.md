## Stretch Goal ##

1. Show all file with ls: ls -r foldername
2. Making parent directories with mkdir: mkdir -r parents/children/grandchildren
3.  Removing directories: rm -r parents 
4. Argument for each command:
   * **ls** can goes with or without argument -- which is the folder that it will display the content. When it stands alone, it display content of the current folder. It can display what's in 2 directories or more. Example: ls single married
   * **mkdir** always have to use an argument -- which is the name of folder it's going to creat. When "mkdir" goes with flag -r, it can creates a parents directories.
   * **rm** always have to use an argument, which is the name of file it's going to delete. When use with -r, it can delete a folder. It can take multiple arguments at once. Example: rm -r married single parents/child/test.md. If we don't give it any argument, this command will not be execute
